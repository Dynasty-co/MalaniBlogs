        <h3 class="mt-3">Gold Jewelry Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          Congratulations! You have purchased an exclusive piece of
          jewelry, which is 22K/18K Gold guaranteed (or as described
          in your Sales Receipt) by Malani Jewelers, Inc, the standard
          bearers of purity and exemplary craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-1">
          Malani's Limited Lifetime Guarantee & Complimentary Service
          Policy
        </h3>
        <p>
          Any gold and diamond jewelry purchased from Malani Jewelers
          will be cleaned and polished free of charge, if the
          ownership of the jewelry belongs to the original purchaser.
          Malani Diamonds must be brought to our showroom for a
          professional cleaning and inspection once every quarter. At
          this time, your Diamond Certificate will be validated by a
          Malani Jewelers Manager/Sales associate. If at any time your
          Malani Diamond is lost from its original mounting, return
          the mounting along with this diamond certificate to our
          showroom for a free replacement (up to 0.1 Ct). The coverage
          of this warranty extends only to your Malani Diamond
          purchase. Malani Jewelers will not cover jewelry if found to
          be tampered with or damaged due to DIY or unprofessional
          repairs. This warranty does not cover loss or damage that is
          incurred in anything other than normal wear and tear*. Your
          personal insurance company should be responsible for the
          replacement of any diamonds of 0.10 ct and up. This warranty
          only covers certain manufacturing defects.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-1">Gold And Gemstone Jewelry Warranty</h3>
        <p>
          22K Gold is one of the softest, precious metals on Earth and
          should be treated with extreme care. All clasps, earring
          backs and findings have ninety (90) days of limited
          warranty. Merchandise, once repaired, may not look as it
          originally appeared. Any gemstones lost from the original
          mount will be replaced, depending upon the gemstone
          availability and your willingness to our choice of a
          substitute; at no charge if no sign of tampering is
          observed. ** Beyond 90-Days, the customer will be
          responsible for any out-pocket charges Malani, Inc. incurs
          on the customer's behalf. (Restringing of beads is not part
          of this warranty)
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-1">How To Take Care of Your Jewelry</h3>
        <p>
          Special care should be given to all Gemstone & Diamond
          Jewelry. Avoid heat, strong cleaning solutions, ultra-sonic
          cleaning, and rough mishandling. Perfume/Hair
          Spray/Cologne/Make-Up or other Chemicals could damage the
          micro-porosity of Gold. Do not let your Diamonds and gems
          come in contact with chlorine or bleach because it can pit
          or discolor the mounting. Do not wear your diamonds and gems
          when your are doing any kind of household or manual labor.
          Although durable, a hard blow along the grain, can chip
          diamonds and gems. Do not store your diamonds and gemstone
          stones pieces all together in a drawer or jewelry case as
          they can scratch each other and also scratch other jewelry.
          Sometimes the corrosion of the metal may occur, forming very
          dark chemical compounds under the subsurface if exposed to a
          moist or wet condition. For more specific instructions on
          how to take care of your jewelry, please visit our website
