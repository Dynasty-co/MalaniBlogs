            Malani's Limited Lifetime Guarantee & Complimentary
            Service Policy
          </h3>
          <p>
            Any gold and diamond jewelry purchased from Malani
            Jewelers will be cleaned and polished free of charge, if
            the ownership of the jewelry belongs to the original
            purchaser. Malani Diamonds must be brought to our showroom
            for a professional cleaning and inspection once every
            quarter. At this time, your Diamond Certificate will be
            validated by a Malani Jewelers Manager/Sales associate. If
            at any time your Malani Diamond is lost from its original
            mounting, return the mounting along with this diamond
            certificate to our showroom for a free replacement (up to
            0.1 Ct). The coverage of this warranty extends only to
            your Malani Diamond purchase. Malani Jewelers will not
            cover jewelry if found to be tampered with or damaged due
            to DIY or unprofessional repairs. This warranty does not
            cover loss or damage that is incurred in anything other
            than normal wear and tear*. Your personal insurance
            company should be responsible for the replacement of any
            diamonds of 0.10 ct and up. This warranty only covers
            certain manufacturing defects.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-1">Gold And Gemstone Jewelry Warranty</h3>
          <p>
            22K Gold is one of the softest, precious metals on Earth
            and should be treated with extreme care. All clasps,
            earring backs and findings have ninety (90) days of
            limited warranty. Merchandise, once repaired, may not look
            as it originally appeared. Any gemstones lost from the
            original mount will be replaced, depending upon the
            gemstone availability and your willingness to our choice
            of a substitute; at no charge if no sign of tampering is
            observed. ** Beyond 90-Days, the customer will be
            responsible for any out-pocket charges Malani, Inc. incurs
            on the customer's behalf. (Restringing of beads is not
            part of this warranty)
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-1">How To Take Care of Your Jewelry</h3>
          <p>
            Special care should be given to all Gemstone & Diamond
            Jewelry. Avoid heat, strong cleaning solutions,
            ultra-sonic cleaning, and rough mishandling. Perfume/Hair
            Spray/Cologne/Make-Up or other Chemicals could damage the
            micro-porosity of Gold. Do not let your Diamonds and gems
            come in contact with chlorine or bleach because it can pit
            or discolor the mounting. Do not wear your diamonds and
            gems when your are doing any kind of household or manual
            labor. Although durable, a hard blow along the grain, can
            chip diamonds and gems. Do not store your diamonds and
            gemstone stones pieces all together in a drawer or jewelry
            case as they can scratch each other and also scratch other
            jewelry. Sometimes the corrosion of the metal may occur,
            forming very dark chemical compounds under the subsurface
            if exposed to a moist or wet condition. For more specific
            instructions on how to take care of your jewelry, please
