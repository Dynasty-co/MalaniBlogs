              Each piece of jewelry has a story to tell and a memory to cherish.
              So, what's your story? Every kid carries a different personality,
              and you must do little research to complement their cuteness with
              the jewelry. Gifting gold jewelry is a quick idea but finding a
              perfect online jewelry shop is not. If you want to buy an
              engravable gold pendant or a pendant with the first initials of
              your son's name to add a personal touch to his sports championship
              celebration, stop by Malani Jeweler's online shopping website to

              </div>

              <p>
                Gold earrings take us on a walk into the roots of ear-piercing
                culture celebrated worldwide to signify cultural heritage,
                upbringing, wealth, protection from the evil eye, and fertility.
                At a very early age, most girls get their ears pierced in parts
                of many countries, including Asian countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Find unique and masterpiece designs in Kids' gold earrings at
                Malani Jewelers' online website. If you are your daughter's
                fashion designer, we understand your struggle to impress her.
                Our tiny machine-polished gold screw-back earrings will add a
                stylish glow to her outfit. The screw-back earrings are highly
                recommended for your little one if you are buying her a first
                pair of earrings, because this screw-back keeps earrings firm in
                one place and secure from being lost or misplaced; in between,
                check and retighten them sometimes.

          <p>
            The size of the earrings is the other most important thing you need
            to keep in mind while shopping. Always remember, every child has
            different shaped and sized earlobes. Just because kids are small
            doesn't mean they have small earlobes too. Get a medium-sized
            single-top earring so that it won't look oversized to her face or
            too small; after a year or two, kids will grow, and the size also
            changes.
