						Let the sunshine in with vibrant colors and mesmerizing jewelry into
						your life this Holi. The most awaited and exhilarating festival Holi
						is a famous Indian festival that falls every year on the full moon
						day in March, known as Falguna per the Hindu calendar. This festival
						marks the arrival of spring and the end of winter, a time of renewal
						and rejuvenation. It celebrates spring which cherishes new
						beginnings, growth, and prosperity. The festival of Holi is
						celebrated as a devotional tribute to the eternal love of Lord
						Krishna and Radha. The ritual of Holika Dahan is also popularly
						observed in parts of the country, signifying the victory of good
						over evil.
