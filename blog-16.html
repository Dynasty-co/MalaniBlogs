							Let the sunshine in with vibrant colors and mesmerizing jewelry
							into your life this Holi. The most awaited and exhilarating
							festival Holi is a famous Indian festival that falls every year on
							the full moon day in March, known as Falguna per the Hindu
							calendar. This festival marks the arrival of spring and the end of
							winter, a time of renewal and rejuvenation. It celebrates spring
							which cherishes new beginnings, growth, and prosperity. The
							festival of Holi is celebrated as a devotional tribute to the
							eternal love of Lord Krishna and Radha. The ritual of Holika Dahan
							is also popularly observed in parts of the country, signifying the
							victory of good over evil.
