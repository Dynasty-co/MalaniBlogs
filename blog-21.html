              Eid is also known as Eid al-Fitr, one of the most significant
              festivals celebrated by Muslims all around the world. This joyous
              occasion marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, during which
              people fast from sunrise to sunset, abstaining from food and drink
              to purify their souls and strengthen their faith.
