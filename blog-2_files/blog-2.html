								The inspiration behind Navaratna Meenakari work in jewelry comes
								from two vast horizons of history. The word 'Navaratna' is
								derived from two Sanskrit words 'Nava' means 'Nine' and 'Ratna'
								means 'Gemstones'. It acknowledges the significance of
								southeastern Asian culture that denotes emblems of wealth,
								prestige, and prodigy. It adheres to a protective power for
								health benefits and well-being. This art portrays an interplay
								of astrology and cosmology. If you believe in astrology then you
								can customize your gemstone jewelry from the Malanis' based on
								your zodiac sign. The cultural background of the Meenakari
								artwork connects its dots from the Persian word 'Minoo' a
								feminine form of heaven and the word 'Meena' states the meaning
								of an azuring color of the sky. It depicts an amazing arena of
								the Mughal empire and elaborates on the patterns and motifs that
								are highly inspired by the great architecture of Persia. Wear an
								incredible gemstone meenakari choker set with a saree or with an
								ethnic indo-western outfit, it turns out to be the best look of
								yours. Two categories of meenakari jewelry; popularly known as
								"Ek rang khula" and "Panchrangi Meena" set a rush in demand in
								the jewelry industry. A single color of enamel is carved for the
								entire design in the first category and five colors are pearl
								white, powder blue, ink blue, ruby red &amp; forest green
								crafted in the second. From Mongols to Indians this design has
								shown its prominence for centuries among jewelry lovers.
								Especially, women get smitten by the regalia of Meenakari
								artistry.
