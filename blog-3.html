					An exhilarating spirit of celebrating the glorious history and
					praising God for blessing people with abundant harvesting sounds
					synonymous with every house in America on Thanksgiving Day. The
					chirping of birds on a chilly morning sprinkles an aroma of nostalgia
					on the fourth Thursday of November, every year.

							An azuring sky welcomes the Great American Dream with an open arm
							to soar high. An anthem of merriment &amp; valor is sung all over
							the country and the ripples of happiness touch the shores of
							families after a long wait to observe this annual holiday with
							lots of gifts and surprises. Holding each other's hands at the
							dining table and praying to the lord, thanking Him for everything
							HE has bestowed upon people is a rich and sacred age-old ritual
							followed on the eve of Thanksgiving day. Lets sing the song of
							thankfulness tuning with the lyrics of appreciation and happiness
							written by the great poet Pierpoint.

							Rituals of this festival play a vital role in enhancing the
							significance of its deep-rooted culture &amp; values and at the
							same time tickles a bubble of excitement. On this auspicious day,
							people host a banquet feast for their near and dear ones followed
							by a breaking off of the y-shaped wishbone, a thrilling football
							match, and clinking cheers of wine &amp; music. There is a very
							interesting fact behind this wishbone ritual, whoever splits the
							bigger one is believed to have all wishes get fulfilled in the
							future. So, what are you waiting for? Make the winner's wish come
							true, and gift a jewel box of dreams and prosperity from Malani's
							collections.

							"Good food always brings a good mood." A large Roasted Turkey
							placed in the center of the dining table sets the mood of the
							party. As per tradition, the head of the family performs the
							carving of Turkey. Kids to youngsters and even elderly people
							everyone is mad over this finger-licking yummy dish. A palate full
							of sweet and savory delicacies is served with love. Who says the
							bird happens to be the hero of all dishes? The real fun of this
							fiesta lies in the flavors of side dishes. A long list of enticing
							and flavorful quintessential Thanksgiving side dishes recipes is
							being cooked in millions of kitchens in America, keeping the
							classic touch intact and mashed potatoes come top on the list. A
							forkful of turkey dipped in mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce is
							a mouth-watering combination, most people relish. Other
							complimenting side dishes that rule the dinner table are stuffing,
							sprouts, sweet potato casserole, gravy, and a green bean
							casserole. " All is well that ends well." Must have heard this
							phrase before, right? Without a spoonful of a cakey dessert, how
							can your Thanksgiving dinner be complete? Having a morsel of
							pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving dinner connects the dots of memory
							lane and thoughts of those soothing palms of your granny fill your
							face with cheerfulness.
