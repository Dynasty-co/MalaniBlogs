              <i>Raksha Bandhan</i> is the most celebrated festival for Asians,
              which appreciates the precious bond between brothers and sisters.
              This joyous occasion is followed by an auspicious ritual where the
              sister ties a silk thread knot (Bandhan) around her brother's
              wrist, asking for safety (Raksha). As the ceremony of Rakhi
              approaches, finding the perfect gift for your sister becomes a
