                      Bhai Dooj is a traditional Hindu festival which
                      is widely observed just after Diwali, the
                      auspicious festival of lights, celebrating the
                      beautiful bond between brothers and sisters. As
                      a part of the ritual during this festival,
                      sisters perform a traditional
                      <i>tilak</i> ceremony on their brothers'
                      foreheads with <i>Roli and Akshat</i> to convey
                      blessings for a bright and prosperous future.
                      This year, make your brother's day by gifting
                      him the perfect blend of love and luxury with
                      our spectacular designs in gold jewelry. Explore
                      the enduring sparkle of men's jewelry in our
                      premium collection and find that perfect gift
                      which will let your precious bond shine
