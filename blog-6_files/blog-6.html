								Gold is an aegis in times of financial crisis. It has more
								liquidity in comparison to other assets. Whichever investment
								field it is; nothing can assure return and flexibility as Gold
								does. For instance, you can buy and sell Gold within minutes.
								But to liquidate FDs, bonds, real estate or stock marketing into
								cash is a very time taking affair. Dating back to history, many
								governments were seen clearing their debts using gold reserves.
								In the time of emergency gold is your real friend. That's why in
								earlier times people believed in the tradition of gifting gold
								jewelry at the time of marriage aiming for future security. A
								rich collection of gold coins in different sizes and weights are
								available on the Malani Jewelers online shopping website. Buy a
								classic QUEEN coin or a beautiful LAXMI coin in 22k gold and
