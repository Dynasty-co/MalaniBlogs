				History has preserved a wellspring of interesting jewelry-related facts
				and the art of ornamentation. The concept of Mangalsutra and its designs
				denotes a rich cultural background and has evolved over centuries. The
				semantics of 'MangalSutra' refers to a Sanskrit word that means a
				'sacred thread'. The groom ties the knot of Mangalsutra around the
				bride's neck is believed to be a prevalent ritual in Hindu Weddings.
				From traditional single yellow thread/THAALI design to modern black
				beads embedded with a pendant design, the necklace Mangalsutra has
				varied from region to region. Generally, black, red, gold and white
				beads are used to make Mangalsutra. It is commonly believed that the
				sacred thread of Mangalsutra defines the bonding of Lord Shiva and
				Goddess Parvati. The gold portion and black beads in Mangalsutra embody
				Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, respectively.
